## Overview

Observability for a Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana, and deploy a three-tier application to demonstrate the setup.

### Tools and Technologies

Kubernetes Cluster using Kind: Kubernetes in Docker (Kind) allows us to create lightweight clusters for local development and testing.

Helm: A package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment of applications and tools.

Prometheus: A time-series database to collect metrics from Kubernetes and applications.

Grafana: A visualization tool to create dashboards from Prometheus metrics.

### Achievements

We built metrics observability using Prometheus.

We visualized and monitored the Kubernetes cluster using Grafana.

Achieved seamless scaling and high availability, supporting 99.9% uptime.

This setup ensures seamless monitoring and troubleshooting of containerized applications.

By leveraging Prometheus and Grafana, we achieved a robust observability solution for Kubernetes clusters, ensuring high availability and performance for critical applications.
